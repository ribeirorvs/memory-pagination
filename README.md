## About the changes

The original simulator have only two algorithms, FIFO and LRU, my improvement are include more two algorithms, LFU and OTIMO. Other improvmente I did is the change of the presentation. In the original, the sequence of proccess are ordened by the next to be substituted, but it turn the result dificult to understand, thinking in that I change the presentation to order the proccess in order it is included in the memory.

## Todo

To conclude this project I will do the follow changes.

- Include MRU algo
- Change the process list input method to a unique list of integers
- Change the structure of the project to use OO (Object Oriented)
- Change the package structure
- Change the project to a JEE
- Use Maven to manage the dependencies
- Change the GUI to a web browser version
- Change the project to MVC pattern
